Hi, my name is Mehrad.
I am an undergraduate student at the University of Calgary.
Today, I want to talk about Augmented Presentation.
As you can see when I talk about something, we can augment presentation using an augmented reality interface.
We have several features
1 live kinetic typography, 
2 embedded icons, 
3 embedded visuals, 
4 an embedded annotation to a physical object.
All components are interactive with gestural interactions. 
And most importantly all animations happen in real-time. 
This means that no video editing or programming is required. 

This enables more expressive and engaging real-time live presentations for many applications like classroom lectures.

In this talk, I want to describe the design and implementation of our system.
